// Doubly Linked List


// Think of your daily commute on the subway as a real-world example of a doubly linked list.
// Your home is the head of the list, your place of work is the tail, and every stop in between is another node in the list.
// In the morning when you take the subway to get to work, you are traversing the list from the head to the tail, using the stop’s next pointer. While this can also be done using a singly linked list, a doubly linked list will also allow you to traverse back through the list easily, using the stop’s previous pointer. You will take the exact same route to get home, just in reverse.

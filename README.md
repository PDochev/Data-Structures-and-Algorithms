# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript. It also includes descriptions and explanations of the concepts and principles behind the algorithms and data structures.

## Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures are sequences of elements in which only one element can be directly reached. Each element in a linear data structure is attached to its previous and next element. Examples of linear data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

## Complex Data Structures

Complex data structures are composed of multiple linear data structures or other complex data structures. Examples of complex data structures include trees, graphs, and heaps.

## Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. They are used to manipulate data and perform operations on data structures. Examples of algorithms include searching, sorting, and graph traversal algorithms.
